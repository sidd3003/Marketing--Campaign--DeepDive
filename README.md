# Marketing Campaign DeepDive

## Project Background
This project focuses on optimizing a year-end sale campaign for a superstore by offering a gold membership exclusively for existing customers, priced at $499 (down from $999), which provides a 20% discount on all purchases. The goal is to identify which customer segments will most likely purchase this offer. By predicting the most responsive customers, the store aims to reduce campaign costs and maximize sales through a targeted marketing approach.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset contains various customer demographics, purchase history, and responses to past campaigns, can be found [here](https://github.com/sidd3003/Marketing--Campaign--DeepDive/blob/main/superstore_data.csv).

## Executive Summary
This project aims to identify which customers are most likely to avail the new gold membership offer, helping the superstore reduce marketing costs while boosting sales. Using customer demographics, purchase behaviors, and past campaign responses, a dashboard using **Power BI** was developed to predict customer responses and analyze key factors driving their behavior.

Key observations indicate that Elite Customers—primarily adults who recently made purchases—account for 86% of total sales. Married and graduated individuals show a strong likelihood to buy the membership, especially those who prefer non-vegetarian items like meat and fish. While in-store purchases dominate, efforts to encourage online sales should be explored. Married couples are particularly interested in Gold Products, providing a strong revenue source.
