# Marketing Campaign DeepDive

## Project Background
This project optimizes a year-end sale campaign for a superstore by offering a gold membership to existing customers, priced at $499 (down from $999). The membership provides a 20% discount on all purchases. The goal is to identify customer segments most likely to purchase this offer, helping reduce campaign costs and maximize sales through a targeted marketing approach.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset, which includes customer demographics, purchase history, and past campaign responses, can be found [here](https://github.com/sidd3003/Marketing--Campaign--DeepDive/blob/main/superstore_data.csv).

## Executive Summary
This project identifies which customers are most likely to purchase the new gold membership offer, helping the superstore reduce marketing costs and increase sales. By analyzing customer demographics, purchase behavior, and past campaign responses, a Power BI dashboard was developed to predict customer responses and highlight key drivers of purchasing behavior.

Key observations indicate that Elite Customers, primarily adults with recent purchases, account for 86% of total sales. Married and college-educated(graduates) individuals show a strong likelihood to purchase the membership, especially those who prefer non-vegetarian items. While in-store purchases dominate, strategies to encourage online sales should be considered. Married couples show high interest in Gold Products, making them an ideal target for revenue-focused promotions.

## Recommendations
Based on the key observations, the following strategies are recommended:

    * Focus the campaign on Elite Customers, who account for the largest share of sales and are likely to purchase the     
       offer, reducing campaign costs by focusing on the most responsive segment.

#### Category 3. Customize Promotions:
    * Maintain and enhance customer satisfaction by tailoring promotions that align with Elite Customers' preferences for        non-vegetarian items, ensuring these are   
      timely and fresh to build a strong online presence.
#### Category 4. Encourage Online Purchases:
    * Highlight the convenience and benefits of online transactions, especially to Elite Customers, to increase online           purchases and use of the gold membership.
#### Category 5. Enhance Gold Product Promotions:
    * Create special offers or exclusive discounts for Gold Products aimed at married couples, a high-revenue segment.
#### Category 6. Continuously Monitor and Refine:
    * Regularly analyze customer data, feedback, and campaign results to optimize and adjust targeting for future       
      campaigns.
      
## Assumptions and Caveats
#### Assumptions:
    * The data accurately represents customer behavior and purchasing habits.
    * Elite Customers will continue with similar purchasing patterns, and their preference for in-store shopping will not        change dramatically.
#### Caveats:
    * The predictive model relies on historical data, which may not capture changes in customer preferences or external          factors (e.g., economic shifts).
    * While the membership is attractively priced, appeal may vary by region and demographic.

## Conclusion
Implementing these recommendations allows the superstore to reduce campaign costs by targeting the right customers for     the gold membership offer. The predictive  model helps identify potential buyers, enabling a more efficient and     
targeted campaign approach.

**Note**: These observations and recommendations are based on the available data and provide valuable insights for decision-making. Further analysis may uncover additional growth and optimization opportunities for the company.
